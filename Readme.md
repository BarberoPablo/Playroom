### You can connect to both links and play against yourself to try it out

# Project idea:

It is about a web page where connected users can play against each other, the game available right now is "TicTacToe", soon there will be a "Tetris" and a "Draw and guess" game. 

It all started with the desire of learning Web Socket Servers so I decided to develop a chat.
When I finished it, I saw the potential of the technology that I was using so I decided to develop this web page where Users choose an Avatar and a Username. After that they get redirected to the main site where they can play different types of games.

The layout was divided in four sections:
* Sider: where I placed the messaging chat previously programmed.
* Header: where the user is able to change his Avatar and username.
* Body where you can se all the available games, online users and users already playing.
* Footer: with my social media links.

A cool feature that I aded to the messaging chat was that when two users decide to play together they are redirected to a private chat room, where only them can see each others messages, and when they decide to stop playing they get redirected to the general chat room with the rest of the users.

What started with a simple messaging chat, ended up beeing part of a multiplayer web page where users can have a conversation and play games. Thats what I love the most about programming, taking pieces of proyects that dont shine in their own but when they are combined with others they make a really good product.
